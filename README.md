# 🎲 Number Guesser Project

A logic-based Python game where the player has to guess a secret number with limited attempts.

## 📝 Description
This is a Command Line Interface (CLI) game that generates a random number between **1 and 100**. The player has **5 attempts** to guess the correct number. The program provides dynamic feedback ("Higher" or "Lower") after each guess to help the player narrow down the answer.

## ✨ Features
- **Range:** Randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- **Difficulty:** Strict limit of 5 attempts.
- **Smart Feedback:** Tells you if your guess is too high or too low.
- **Custom Personality:** Unique victory messages depending on whether you win on the 1st try (Legend status) or the last try (Close call).
- **Error Handling:** The game won't crash if you accidentally type text instead of a number.
